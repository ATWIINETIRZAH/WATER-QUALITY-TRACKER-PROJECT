# WATER QUALITY TRACKER PROJECT
  This project works by testing water ph levels and turbidity levels to determine whether the water is clean and healthy for consumption.
  The project integrates water quality sensors, robotics/IoT technology, and data science to create a real-time monitoring system. It emphasizes calculating average water quality, analyzing water pH levels, and identifying safe areas for water consumption.
Objectives
- Calculate average water quality.
- Analyze water pH levels.
- Integrate robotics/IoT for enhanced data collection.
- Utilize data science to identify safe areas.
